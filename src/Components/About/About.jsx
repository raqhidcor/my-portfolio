          I'm a Full-Stack Developer living in Valencia (Spain).

        <p className="about-description">
          I'm willing to take any challenge to grow in the tech industry; I
          studied Journalism but I made the decision to become a career changer
          since I always felt this connection with computers and web development
          so this curiosity drove me to take a Web Development Bootcamp at the
          tech school Ironhack where I could develop full-stack apps and learn a
          tech-stack that allows me to create my path in this fascinating world.
          <br></br>

        <p  className="about-description">
            With a background in team and project management, I developed a
            logical and detail-orientated mindset necessary in a busy and
            autonomous working environment. My experience as Customer Service
            Representative enhanced these skills and I quickly learnt to adapt
            and communicate under pressure. It was through these experiences and
            the skills that I learnt that I came to realise my goal of becoming
            a web developer.
